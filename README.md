Memory Match Tiles is a simple memory match game in the spirit of the Windows 8 user interface. With three levels of difficulty, see how fast you can match tiles, numbers, or letters and how long of a streak you can get!

I created this for a MicroConf App Contest that Microsoft held in March and April of 2013. With my strong front end developer skills, I spent part of a weekend throwing this together so that I could not only possibly winning something in the contest, but also to get my foot in the door to creating apps for Windows 8, Surface devices and possibly even Windows Phone 8. I have ideas on improving Memory Match Tiles further, like a high score list, using photos in tiles and a marathon mode, but for now, this is what you get. I never got around to certifying and publishing the app, but if I do, it will be with a rewrite.
